# JavaScript Trivia
 A collection of trivial/stupid scripts mostly intended to teach myself and others JavaScript and/or Computer Science concepts. 

I spent quite a bit of time trying to decide whether or not to put this online, then I read the phrase "if something is worth doing, it's worth doing poorly."

Please do not consider this a measure of what I consider to be good code. I'd suggest this is only worthwhile as a vague indicator of my laziness, impatience and hubris.  

Every script stands alone, *should* run both in the browser and in node, and should do absolutely nothing (except contaminate namespaces).
