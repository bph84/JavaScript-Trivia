# JavaScript Trivia

A collection of trivial/stupid scripts mostly intended to teach myself and others JavaScript and/or Computer Science concepts. 

Every script stands alone, *should* run both in the browser and in node, and *should* do absolutely nothing (except contaminate namespaces). 

**Please do not consider this a measure of what I consider to be good code.**

This is a long way away from what I'd consider production code (not least since it literally does nothing). Next to no thought has been given to structure (it's literally just a bunch of scripts). 

I'd suggest this is only worthwhile as a vague indicator of my laziness, impatience and hubris. If nothing else, it serves to demonstrate that I generally like what I do.
